# DRY, KISS, YAGNI

**DRY** stands for _Don't Repeat Yourself_, which means you shouldn't write the
same code over and over again. Instead, you should try to reuse code as much as
possible to keep things efficient.

**KISS** stands for _Keep It Simple, Stupid_. It means you should try to keep
your code simple and easy to understand. Don't overcomplicate things if you
don't need to.

**YAGNI** stands for _You Ain't Gonna Need It_. This principle suggests that you
shouldn't add functionality to your code unless you actually need it. So, don't
waste time and effort on features that might not be necessary.
