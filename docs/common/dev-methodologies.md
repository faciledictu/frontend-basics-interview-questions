# Development Methodologies

Methodologies provide a structured approach to software development, ensuring
consistency, predictability, and quality. They help teams manage complexity,
facilitate communication, and improve efficiency by setting clear guidelines and
processes.

## Software Development Life Cycle

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) refers to the process of planning,
creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

### Participants

Participants typically include product owner, project manager, business
analysts, developers, testers, and operations staff.

### Stages

The main stages include:

- **Planning**: Defining objectives, scope, and feasibility.
- **Requirements Analysis**: Gathering and documenting requirements.
- **Design**: Creating architecture and detailed design.
- **Implementation**: Writing the actual code.
- **Testing**: Verifying that the software meets requirements.
- **Deployment**: Releasing the product to users.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and enhancement.

### Basic Models

Choosing a model depends on project requirements and team dynamics.

#### Waterfall

It is one of the earliest SDLC approaches. Each stage must be completed before
the next one begins, and there is typically no overlap between the phases.

**Strengths**: Simple, easy to understand and manage, suitable for projects with
well-defined requirements.

**Weaknesses**: Inflexible, difficult to accommodate changes, testing phase
comes late in the cycle.

#### Agile

Agile is iterative and incremental, allowing for changes and improvements
throughout the development process.

**Strengths**: Flexible, adaptive to changes, continuous feedback and
improvement, early detection of issues through iterative cycles.

:::info Concept of Shift-Left Testing

Shift-left testing involves integrating testing activities earlier in the SDLC.
It aims to identify and address defects sooner, improving quality and reducing
time and cost associated with later-stage fixes.

:::

**Weaknesses**: Can be challenging to manage scope, requires a high level of
collaboration and commitment.

### Agile Methodologies

Agile principles can be applied through regular iterations, continuous feedback,
and adaptive planning.

#### Kanban

Kanban is a visual management method for workflow, emphasizing continuous
delivery, flexibility, and efficiency by using a Kanban board to visualize tasks
and their progress.

#### Scrum

Scrum is a framework within Agile, focusing on fixed-length iterations
(sprints), with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team)
and ceremonies.

**Ceremonies** are related to sprint stages:

- Sprint planning,
- Daily stand-ups during sprint execution,
- Sprint review,
- Retrospective.

Accurate **effort estimating** helps in planning sprints and allocating
resources effectively. In Scrum, story points or hours might be used to estimate
the effort for user stories in the backlog.

:::tip What is the Difference

Agile is a broad philosophy with various methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.

Kanban is a method within Agile that focuses on continuous delivery without
fixed iterations.

Scrum is a specific Agile framework with fixed iterations and roles.

#### Project Management Tools

Jira is a project management tool widely used in Agile development. It helps
teams plan, track, and manage software development projects by providing
features like backlog management, sprint planning, and real-time collaboration.
Jira's integration capabilities and customizable workflows make it a versatile
tool for managing complex projects.
