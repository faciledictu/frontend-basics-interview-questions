# react-dom package

The primary purpose of `react-dom` is to allow React to interact with the
browser's Document Object Model (DOM). It supports all of the browser built-in
HTML and SVG components providing methods for its rendering and managing
updates.

React is designed to be platform-agnostic. By separating ReactDOM, it becomes
easier to create other renderers for different platforms, like React Native for
mobile.
