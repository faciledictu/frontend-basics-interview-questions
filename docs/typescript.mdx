# Overview of TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft.
It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors
during development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, ensuring
compatibility with existing codebases and JavaScript libraries.
